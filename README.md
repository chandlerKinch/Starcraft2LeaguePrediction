Starcraft 2 is a highly competitive Real Time Strategy(RTS) game published by Blizzard
Entertainment in 2010. It is a game of resource management, unit manipulation and ever
changing strategy. The goal of the game is to build an army from the ground up and use it to
outsmart and out maneuver one’s enemy to victory. Ever since it’s release, millions of RTS
lovers have strived to perfect their game and climb in rank on Starcraft 2’s ladder system, myself
included. This requires hours of gameplay, watching videos, reading strategies and perfecting
skills. There are a lot of things to focus on when trying to improve, and my question is ‘What
matters the most when trying to improve at Starcraft 2?’. I also wanted to make a model that
would predict league placement and another model for smurf detection.
